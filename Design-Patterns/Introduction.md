**Design pattern is a general reusable solution or template to a commonly occurring problem in software design. The patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects. The idea is to speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigm.**

### Goal:
- Understand the problem and matching it with some pattern.
- Reusage of old interface or making the present design reusable for the future usage.

### Types of Design Patterns
There are mainly three types of design patterns:

#### 1. *Creational*
---
These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. These patterns can be further categorized into Class-creational patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

*Creational* design patterns are `Factory Method`, `Abstract Factory`, `Builder`, `Singleton`, `Object Pool` and `Prototype`.
